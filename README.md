### Code from my video

here is the google colab link. It doesn't have as much stuff as the .ipynb file here in thsi repo; the colab only exists so that i can use their GPUs

As far as stuff you haven't seen in the video, the file `best_tokens.json` is my attempt to search for a better token to use (one that actually has a triple phase change point within the reasonable domain of values that the model would use). There's a bunch of photos here from the experiment that I ofc couldn't include in the colab. Might make other updates in the future, idk i tend to abandon ideas pretty quickly and it's already been like half a week since i've worked on this
